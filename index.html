  <h1>The Basics</h1>
  <p>I’m kinda a country hick who appreciates the finer or better things in life. My life travels and experiences have exposed me to a variety of people and geographies. These experiences led me to feel at home in the small rural parts of the west.</p>
  <p>Real and down to earth people are important to me. I’m very tired of “fake” folks who are trying to be something or someone just to impress someone or to feel self-important. </p>

  <h1>Roots</h1>
  <p>I grew up in a small farm town in Eastern Idaho, St Anthony. Following my ninth grade year, we moved briefly to Orange County California. This lasted only 8 months, eventually retreating back to Eastern Idaho to the town of Idaho Falls. I attended college in North Idaho, University of Idaho in Moscow. I’ve spent many summers in Sun Valley Idaho and 20 years in Seattle before moving back to Idaho. I now reside in Boise on the western side of Idaho.</p>

  <h1>Nutrients</h1>
  <h3>Music</h3>
  <p>I mostly listen to 70’s rock and country and western. Led Zeppelin is probably the best rock band of all time and something I never grow tired of. My son enlightened me to Jack White a few years back. He's certainly an interesting character and I do enjoy his music.</p>
  <h3>Dreaming and/or reliving the past</h3>
  <p>I’m way beyond a dream job at this stage in my life. I’m thinking more about retirement than working. But, reality gets in the way and I still have to work for a few more years.  My dream job would be working for a company called SportVision. I did a part time gig with them and MLB.com a few years back supporting the pitch tracking project that is deployed in each MLB ball park. If I didn’t mind living in big cities, I would have continued with this endeavor. It was a killa great time.</p>
  <h3>Blow my hair back</h3>
  <p>Bicycling is a true passion, just love the solitude. Being a landscape architect by training, I do enjoy gardening and keeping the yard in shape. Other semi-passionate activities include; golfing, hiking, fishing, and skiing. The New York Yankees and the Green Bay Packers are my true spectator passions and consume most of my sports viewing.</p>
